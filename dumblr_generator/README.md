# dumblr_generator

This directory holds the code for generating a dumblr instance.

This site should live on Dat + Hashbase. Why? Even if the code for the original dumblr instance is not available and has no peers, Hashbase will act as a "super peer".

If you are accessing the site via Beaker Browser, you'll be able to create a dumblr instance. Behind the scenes, creating a dumblr instance means forking an existing dumblr instance. The base dumblr instance is being created under `dumblr_template`.
