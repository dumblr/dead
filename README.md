# Dumblr_2

_Because we didn't know what we were doing before._

`dumblr_generator` is the site used to create a new dumblr instance on dat.

`dumblr_template` is the site that is generated by the `dumblr_generator`. Within `dumblr_template`, when you run `yarn build` it will build the site into the `template_build` folder within `dumblr_generator`.

Here are two good resources for Dat API documentation/examples:
